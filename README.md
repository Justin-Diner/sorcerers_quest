** Implementation Timeline **

Friday Afternoon & Weekend - Friday will be spent researching canvas and getting basic building blocks in place for the game. (Creating a color scheme, creating/finding appropriate assets), obtaining general skills to work with Canvas. The weekend will be spent trying to create the main canvas, the background loaded, and the player on the screen. Additionally, the creation of the initial level. General movement of the Sorcerer and Arrows would be a huge plus. 
Monday - Monday will be spent getting the player to move appropriately, loading arrows onto the screen, figuring out flight projetions and collision. Should also consider the start/music button, Github links/personal links, instructions, and general CSS.
